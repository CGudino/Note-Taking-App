# Note taking app

This the first "real" app I built using React. It allows users to create new notes, which are listed on the left side (top side on mobile) of the page. Users can then switch between notes by clicking on them and having the contents of the note appear on the right side (bottom on mobile).

Notes can also be deleted or cleared.

You can run the app by cloning this repo, running npm install, then npm start. Alternatively, you can just go to the link below.
